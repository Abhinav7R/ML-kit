This folder should contain the generalised implementations of all evaluation metrics, in a way such that they can be used for any model as and when needed.  

The measures implemented are:

1. accuracy
2. precision
3. recall
4. f1 score

All the functions take true y values and predicted y values as input  
Note: micro and macro can be given as arguments to the functions(exceptions accuracy) to get the respective type of performance measure.
